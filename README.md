# Titanic-Machine-Learning-Disaster
On 12 April 1912, one of the deadliest disasters happened between Europe and North America. Titanic, also known as a 'Ship of Dreams' sank in the ocean after colliding with an iceberg causing the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers. Unluckily, due to having less number of lifebeats available, many of passengers who were likely to  also died. 
Based on the event happened and neglecting the absence of boats available, the likelyhood of survival was high. Therefore, using the data of all passengers with the given necessary features, through Machine Learning Algorithm, Randomforest, the accuracy is determined with no parameters are tuned. In a layman's terms, which passengers survived and which passengers died needs to be determined
